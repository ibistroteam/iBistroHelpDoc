A quick walk through on placing an order to your vendor.

## Placing an Order in iBistro

## Select an Account

If the displayed account is not the one you want to investigate, use the account selector here:

## Visualize your Account Data

On the screen you will find:

* A total of all upcoming transactions for the coming year.
* A total of all overdue transactions, if any.
* A month-by-month breakdown of upcoming transactions.
* A list of the upcoming transactions for the coming year.
